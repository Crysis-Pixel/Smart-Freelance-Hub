may
 
struggle
 
to
 
gain
 
traction
 
on
 
conventional
 
platforms,
 
is
 
given
 
more
 
opportunities

thrive.
 
By
 
prioritizing

Hub
 
fosters
 
a

Problem
 
Statement
 
The
 
freelancing
 
industry ,
 
while
 
offering
 
immense
 
opportunities,
 
is
 
plagued
 
by
 
significant
 
challenges
 
that
 
disproportionately
 
affect
 
new
 
freelancers.
 
Conventional
 
freelancing
 
platforms
 
like
 
Fiverr ,
 
Upwork,
 
and
 
Freelancer .com
 
prioritize
 
experienced
 
professionals
 
with
 
established
 
portfolios,
 
extensive
 
client
 
reviews,
 
and
 
proven
 
track
 
records.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
new
 
freelancers,
 
despite
 
possessing
 
the
 
necessary
 
skills
 
and
 
qualifications,
 
face
 
significant
 
barriers
 
to
 
entry .
 
This
 
creates
 
a
 
monopolized
 
environment
 
where
 
a
 
small
 
fraction
 
of
 
experienced
 
freelancers
 
dominate
 
job
 
opportunities,
 
leaving
 
newcomers
 
with
 
limited
 
chances
 
to
 
build
 
their
 
reputations
 
or
 
secure
 
work.
 
The
 
lack
 
of
 
visibility
 
for
 
new
 
freelancers
 
not
 
only
 
hinders
 
their
 
professional
 
growth
 
but
 
also
 
stifles
 
the
 
diversity
 
and
 
innovation
 
they
 
could
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
gig
 
economy .
 
Existing
 
platforms
 
inadvertently
 
discourage
 
new
 
talent
 
by
 
emphasizing
 
performance
 
metrics
 
that
 
heavily
 
favor
 
those
 
with
 
long-standing
 
profiles.
 
This
 
results
 
in
 
an
 
uneven
 
playing
 
field,
 
limiting
 
access
 
to
 
opportunities
 
and
 
perpetuating
 
an
 
ecosystem
 
that
 
favors
 
the
 
few
 
over
 
the
 
many .
 
Without
 
a
 
platform
 
that
 
promotes
 
fairness,
 
inclusivity ,
 
and
 
equitable
 
exposure,
 
the
 
gig
 
economy
 
risks
 
alienating
 
new
 
entrants
 
and
 
failing
 
to
 
harness
 
the
 
full
 
potential
 
of
 
emer ging
 
talent.
 
Addressing
 
this
 
imbalance
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
fostering
 
a
 
thriving
 
freelancing
 
ecosystem
 
where
 
all
 
participants,
 
regardless
 
of
 
experience
 
level,
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
succeed.
 
Smart
 
Freelance
 
Hub
 
seeks
 
to
 
resolve
 
this
 
issue
 
by
 
providing
 
a
 
platform
 
that
 
promotes
 
inclusivity ,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
new
 
freelancers
 
gain
 
the
 
visibility
 
and
 
opportunities
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
thrive
 
while
 
maintaining
 
quality
 
and
 
satisfaction
 
for
 
clients.

Introduction
 
1.1
 
Background
 
and
 
Motivation
 
The
 
freelancing
 
industry
 
has
 
under gone
 
exponential
 
growth
 
in
 
recent
 
years,
 
becoming
 
a
 
cornerstone
 
of
 
the
 
modern
 
gig
 
economy .
 
Platforms
 
like
 
Fiverr ,
 
Upwork,
 
and
 
Freelancer .com
 
have
 
revolutionized
 
how
 
freelancers
 
and
 
clients
 
connect,
 
offering
 
millions
 
of
 
individuals
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
showcase
 
their
 
skills
 
and
 
collaborate
 
globally .
 
However ,
 
while
 
these
 
platforms
 
have
 
been
 
instrumental
 
in
 
expanding
 
freelancing
 
as
 
a
 
career
 
path,
 
they
 
often
 
fail
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
equitable
 
environment
 
for
 
all
 
participants.
 
Experienced
 
freelancers
 
with
 
established
 
profiles
 
frequently
 
dominate
 
the
 
market,
 
making
 
it
 
difficult
 
for
 
new
 
entrants
 
to
 
gain
 
visibility
 
and
 
secure
 
opportunities.
 
This
 
lack
 
of
 
inclusivity
 
stifles
 
the
 
diversity
 
and
 
innovation
 
that
 
newcomers
 
could
 
bring
 
to
 
the
 
ecosystem,
 
creating
 
significant
 
barriers
 
to
 
entry
 
for
 
skilled
 
but
 
unproven
 
freelancers.
 
Addressing
 
this
 
imbalance
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
fostering
 
a
 
dynamic
 
and
 
supportive
 
freelancing
 
environment.
 
The
 
Smart
 
Freelance
 
Hub
 
project
 
stems
 
from
 
the
 
motivation
 
to
 
tackle
 
these
 
challenges.
 
Recognizing
 
the
 
systemic
 
issues
 
that
 
limit
 
new
 
freelancers’
 
success,
 
the
 
project
 
leverages
 
machine
 
learning
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
fairer
 
platform
 
where
 
opportunities
 
are
 
distributed
 
more
 
equitably .
 
By
 
promoting
 
inclusivity
 
and
 
fairness,
 
Smart
 
Freelance
 
Hub
 
aims
 
to
 
empower
 
both
 
new
 
and
 
experienced
 
freelancers,
 
creating
 
a
 
more
 
balanced
 
and
 
sustainable
 
ecosystem.
 
1.2
 
Purpose
 
and
 
Goal
 
of
 
the
 
Project
 
The
 
primary
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
Smart
 
Freelance
 
Hub
 
is
 
to
 
transform
 
how
 
freelancing
 
platforms
 
operate
 
by
 
introducing
 
an
 
advanced
 
recommendation
 
system
 
that
 
prioritizes
 
inclusivity .
 
The
 
platform’ s
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
new
 
freelancers
 
and
 
seasoned
 
professionals,
 
offering
 
all
 
participants
 
a
 
fair
 
chance
 
to
 
thrive.
 
To
 
achieve
 
this,
 
Smart
 
Freelance
 
Hub
 
employs
 
machine
 
learning
 
algorithms
 
that
 
analyze
 
job
 
postings,
 
freelancer
 
skill
 
sets,
 
and
 
client
 
preferences.
 
Unlike
 
traditional
 
systems
 
that
 
heavily
 
weigh
 
experience
 
and
 
reviews,
 
this
 
platform
 
prioritizes
 
skill
 
relevance
 
and
 
promotes
 
new
 
freelancers
 
by
 
enhancing
 
their
 
visibility .
 
The
 
platform
 
aspires
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
freelancing
 
marketplace
 
that:
 
●
 
Reduces
 
barriers
 
to
 
entry
 
for
 
new
 
freelancers,
 
enabling
 
them
 
to
 
establish
 
their
 
careers.
 
●
 
Provides
 
clients
 
with
 
a
 
diverse
 
pool
 
of
 
talent,
 
ensuring
 
high-quality
 
outcomes
 
and
 
fresh
 
perspectives.
 
●
 
Promotes
 
a
 
balanced
 
and
 
equitable
 
gig
 
economy
 
where
 
opportunities
 
are
 
accessible
 
to
 
all,
 
irrespective
 
of
 
prior
 
experience.

Existing
 
Freelancing
 
Platforms
 
and
 
Their
 
Limitations
 
In
 
recent
 
years,
 
the
 
gig
 
economy
 
has
 
experienced
 
exponential
 
growth,
 
with
 
freelancing
 
becoming
 
a
 
prominent
 
mode
 
of
 
employment
 
across
 
various
 
industries.
 
Numerous
 
platforms
 
have
 
emer ged,
 
offering
 
freelancers
 
and
 
employers
 
a
 
marketplace
 
to
 
connect
 
and
 
collaborate
 
on
 
projects.
 
This
 
review
 
examines
 
four
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
popular
 
freelancing
 
platforms:
 
Fiverr
,
 
Freelancer .com
,
 
Upwork
,
 
and
 
PeoplePerHour
,
 
evaluating
 
their
 
key
 
features,
 
advantages,
 
and
 
challenges.
 
 
Fiverr
 
Fiverr
 
was
 
founded
 
in
 
2010
 
with
 
a
 
unique
 
business
 
model
 
that
 
allows
 
freelancers,
 
called
 
"sellers,"
 
to
 
offer
 
services
 
known
 
as
 
"gigs,"
 
with
 
a
 
starting
 
price
 
of
 
$5.
 
Over
 
time,
 
the
 
platform
 
evolved
 
to
 
accommodate
 
a
 
wider
 
range
 
of
 
pricing
 
and
 
more
 
complex
 
projects.
 
 
 
 
Features:
 
-
 
Gig-Based
 
Structure:
 
Freelancers
 
create
 
predefined
 
service
 
packages
 
(gigs)
 
with
 
set
 
prices,
 
offering
 
a
 
clear
 
structure
 
for
 
buyers.
 
-
 
User-Friendly
 
Interface:
 
Fiverr ’s
 
interface
 
is
 
easy
 
to
 
navigate
 
and
 
appealing
 
to
 
both
 
beginners
 
and
 
experienced
 
freelancers.
 
-
 
Diverse
 
Categories:
 
Fiverr
 
covers
 
a
 
broad
 
spectrum
 
of
 
services,
 
from
 
digital
 
marketing
 
and
 
graphic
 
design
 
to
 
programming
 
and
 
voiceovers.
 
 
Advantages:
 
-
 
Simplicity:
 
Sellers
 
do
 
not
 
need
 
to
 
bid
 
on
 
jobs,
 
reducing
 
the
 
time
 
spent
 
securing
 
projects.
 
-
 
Fast
 
Transactions:
 
Due
 
to
 
the
 
fixed
 
price
 
gig
 
model,
 
projects
 
can
 
be
 
purchased
 
and
 
initiated
 
almost
 
instantly .
 
 
 
Challenges:
 
-
 
Lower
 
Starting
 
Rates:
 
Fiverr's
 
origin
 
as
 
a
 
$5
 
service
 
platform
 
sometimes
 
leads
 
to
 
the
 
undervaluation
 
of
 
complex
 
services.
 
5
 
-
 
Commission
 
Fees:
 
Fiverr
 
charges
 
freelancers
 
a
 
20%
 
commission
 
on
 
every
 
completed
 
gig,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
high
 
for
 
smaller
 
tasks.

-

Feature:

submit
 
entries,

of
 
users
 
worldwide,
 
freelancers
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
vast
 
client
 
base.
 
 
 
Challenges:
 
-
 
High
 
Competition:
 
Due
 
to
 
the
 
large
 
number
 
of
 
freelancers
 
on
 
the
 
platform,
 
competition
 
is
 
fierce,
 
leading
 
to
 
lower
 
bids
 
and
 
potentially
 
undercutting.
 
-
 
Fees:
 
Freelancer .com
 
charges
 
up
 
to
 
10%
 
on
 
completed
 
projects,

Upwork
 
Upwork,
 
formed
 
by
 
the
 
merger
 
of
 
Elance
 
and
 
oDesk
 
in
 
2015,
 
is
 
considered
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
established
 
freelancing
 
platforms.
 
It
 
uses
 
a
 
bidding
 
and
 
proposal
 
system
 
for
 
job
 
applications
 
and
 
offers
 
tools
 
for
 
long-term
 
collaboration
 
between
 
freelancers
 
and
 
clients.
 
 
 
Features:
 
-
 
Escrow
 
Payment
 
System:
 
Upwork
 
uses
 
an
 
escrow
 
system
 
to
 
protect
 
both
 
freelancers
 
and
 
clients
 
by
 
holding
 
funds
 
until
 
milestones
 
or
 
projects
 
are
 
completed.
 
-
 
Time
 
Tracking:
 
The
 
platform
 
offers
 
time-tracking
 
tools
 
that
 
allow
 
freelancers
 
to
 
log
 
billable
 
hours,
 
which
 
is
 
beneficial
 
for
 
hourly
 
contracts.
 
-
 
Talent
 
Matching:
 
Upwork’ s
 
algorithm
 
suggests
 
freelancers
 
to
 
clients
 
based
 
on
 
project
 
needs,
 
streamlining
 
the
 
hiring
 
process.
 
 
 
Advantages:
 
-
 
High-Quality
 
Clients:
 
Upwork
 
attracts
 
well-established
 
businesses
 
and
 
companies,
 
leading
 
to
 
more
 
lucrative
 
and
 
long-term
 
projects.
 
-
 
Flexible
 
Contracts:
 
Freelancers
 
can
 
choose
 
between
 
hourly
 
and
 
fixed-price
 
contracts,
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
job.
 
 
 
Challenges:
 
-
 
Service
 
Fees:
 
Upwork
 
charges
 
freelancers
 
a
 
sliding
 
service
 
fee,
 
starting
 
at
 
20%
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
$500
 
earned
 
per
 
client,
 
which
 
can
 
reduce
 
profits
 
significantly
 
for
 
smaller
 
jobs.
 
-
 
Strict
 
Vetting:
 
New
 
freelancers
 
often
 
face
 
challenges
 
getting
 
approved
 
on
 
Upwork
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
competitive
 
vetting
 
process.

PeoplePerHour
 
Founded
 
in
 
2007,
 
PeoplePerHour
 
is
 
a
 
UK-based
 
freelancing
 
platform
 
that
 
offers
 
a
 
blend
 
of
 
gig-based
 
services
 
and
 
the
 
traditional
 
bidding
 
model.
 
Freelancers
 
can
 
post
 
services
 
(called
 
"Hourlies")
 
or
 
bid
 
for
 
projects
 
posted
 
by
 
clients.
 
 
 
Features:
 
-
 
Hourlies:
 
Freelancers
 
can
 
post
 
fixed-price
 
services
 
that
 
clients
 
can
 
purchase
 
instantly ,
 
similar
 
to
 
Fiverr ’s
 
gig
 
model.
 
-
 
Job
 
Board:
 
Clients
 
post
 
job
 
listings,
 
and
 
freelancers
 
submit
 
proposals,
 
offering
 
a
 
dual
 
method
 
for
 
job
 
acquisition.
 
-
 
Escrow
 
System:
 
PeoplePerHour
 
uses
 
an
 
escrow
 
system
 
to
 
ensure
 
safe
 
transactions
 
between
 
freelancers
 
and
 
clients.
 
 
 
Advantages:
 
-
 
Local
 
and
 
Global
 
Opportunities:
 
While
 
it
 
is
 
UK-based,
 
PeoplePerHour
 
serves
 
a
 
global
 
audience,
 
offering
 
local
 
jobs
 
for
 
UK
 
freelancers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
international
 
work.
 
-
 
Balanced
 
Approach:
 
The
 
platform
 
provides
 
both
 
gig-based
 
services
 
and
 
a
 
traditional
 
bidding
 
process,
 
giving
 
freelancers
 
flexibility
 
in
 
how
 
they
 
secure
 
jobs.
 
 
 
Challenges:
 
-
 
Freelancer
 
Approval:
 
PeoplePerHour
 
has
 
a
 
vetting
 
process
 
that
 
restricts
 
entry
 
for
 
new
 
freelancers,
 
particularly
 
in
 
saturated
 
categories.
 
-
 
Service
 
Fees:
 
Freelancers
 
pay
 
20%
 
on
 
earnings
 
up
 
to
 
£250
 
and
 
7.5%
 
thereafter ,
 
which
 
can
 
still
 
be
 
substantial
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
the
 
project.

for
 
the
 
client.
 
●
 
Reduced
 
Unused
 
Codes:
 
We
 
had
 
various
 
codes
 
that
 
were
 
not

either
 
replaced
 
them
 
with
 
better
 
versions
 
or
 
removed
 
them.
 
Continuous
 
monitoring,
 
iterative
 
development,
 
and
 
structured
 
planning
 
were
 
essential
 
to
 
the
 
Smart
 
Freelance
 
Hub's
 
success.
 
By
 
matching
 
goals
 
with
 
user
 
requirements
 
and
 
encouraging
 
24
 
collaboration,
 
the
 
platform
 
is
 
in
 
a
 
strong
 
position

establish
 
itself
 
as
 
a
 
reliable

both
 
clients
 
and
 
freelancers,
 
opening
 
the

7.2
 
Limitations
 
1.
 
Limited
 
Freelancer
 
Rehiring
:
 
Clients
 
are
 
unable
 
to
 
directly
 
rehire
 
the
 
same
 
freelancer
 
unless
 
that
 
individual
 
appears
 
in
 
the
 
platform's
 
recommendation
 
system.
 
This
 
limits
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
clients
 
to
 
easily
 
reconnect
 
with
 
freelancers
 
they
 
have
 
previously
 
worked
 
with.
 
2.
 
Email
 
and
 
OTP
 
Service
 
Restrictions
:
 
The
 
current
 
email
 
service
 
provider
 
imposes
 
limits
 
of
 
3,000
 
emails
 
per
 
month
 
for
 
registration
 
OTPs
 
and
 
1,000
 
emails
 
per
 
day
 
for
 
other
 
OTPs
 
and
 
notifications.
 
This
 
constraint
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
occasional
 
delays
 
or
 
restrictions
 
in
 
sending
 
verification
 
emails
 
and
 
notifications
 
to
 
users.
 
3.
 
Portfolio
 
and
 
Project
 
Showcase
 
Limitations
:
 
Freelancers
 
are
 
unable
 
to
 
upload
 
and
 
showcase
 
their
 
portfolios
 
or
 
previous
 
projects
 
on
 
the
 
platform.
 
This
 
limits
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
their
 
skills
 
and
 
past
 
work
 
to
 
potential
 
clients,
 
potentially
 
affecting
 
their
 
chances
 
of
 
securing
 
projects.
 
4.
 
Lack
 
of
 
real-time
 
updates
 
in
 
the
 
website
:
 
Notifications
 
for
 
new
 
gig
 
offers
 
are
 
not
 
being
 
updated
 
in
 
real-time
 
on
 
the
 
website,
 
which
 
may
 
cause
 
delays
 
in
 
freelancers
 
receiving
 
timely
 
alerts
 
about
 
relevant
 
job
 
opportunities.
 
This
 
impacts
 
the
 
responsiveness
 
of
 
the
 
platform
 
for
 
both
 
freelancers
 
and
 
clients.
 
5.
 
Local
 
Device

The
 
project
 
is
 
currently
 
designed
 
to
 
operate
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
local
 
device,
 
meaning
 
that
 
certain
 
functionalities
 
and
 
features
 
depend
 
on
 
the
 
user’s
 
device
 
capabilities.
